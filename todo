cgi

file upload (currently blocking)
of less importance: file upload in ram
POST request handle header fields
POST request handle json??
loading another client while a cgi script is executing
memory usage


DONE (!) Add a MUST-HAVE header field called "Accept" with the allowed HTTP methods in response to an invalid method

NEW TODO:
    segfault. potential reasons: recv() call from receive request receives 0 and closes the socket which deletes its corresponding request object,
        which is then accessed by passRequestToServer
    body upload in non blocking manner
    cgi request handling
