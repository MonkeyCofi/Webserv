Matt Maltese (feat. Searows): Philadelphia
Sometimes I think that I know
What love's all about
And when I see the light
Well, I know I'll be alright
I've got my friends in the world
I have my friends
When we were boys and girls
And the secrets came unfurled
City of brotherly love
Place I call home
Don't turn your back on me
I don't want to be alone
(Love lasts forever)
Someone is talking to me
Calling my name
Tell me I'm not to blame
I won't be ashamed of love
(Oh, Philadelphia)
City of brotherly love
Brotherly love
Oh-oh
No-no-no, no, no
Hm
Ooh
Sometimes I think that I know
What love's all about
And when I see the light
Well, I know I'll be alright
Oh, Philadelphia

Searows: End of the World
I'm at the end of the world
Out of asking, out of patience
You know enough of the words
I was angry, you're forgiven
And does it get too hard
Bein' a good person every day of your life?
Does it get boring
Making a living out of the things you like?
Without the rain, you're in a bad mood
Or was it lightning? Or is it the wrong shoes?
And it's okay, I'm grateful to you
For letting me lose
And it's a damn shame, you're good at winning
And I can't handle when the fight runs out
When it's a chapter from the beginning
Crashing a boat into the front of your house
I know you don't like the sound
I ran away to the Golden State
Just to see if I could get back home
I know it's not what you thought I'd say
I'm hardly brave, I know
What-a you say to a brand-new ghost
I saw the end of the world last night
I ran to you
I say your name in the warmest way
I look for you when I do

Searows: Keep the Rain
I don't know what steps to take
I do the easy ones until it helps
Little acts of conversation
I don't think I really like myself
Am I comfortable in silence?
Or is it eating me alive
Nothing's ever really quiet
When you need distraction to survive
It's part of me
Wouldn't you believe it's nothing?
It's all you need
When you keep the rain from coming
I'm already going under
Nothing I can do but sit and wait
Are you really having fun or
Do you like becoming what you hate?
Am I comfortable in silence
Or am I waiting till it ends
Nothing's ever really quiet
You were just to stubborn to pretend
It's part of me
Wouldn't you believe it's nothing?
It's all you need
When you keep the rain from coming
I'm good at letting you go
I'm good at letting it get to me
I'm good at letting you go
No, you were never the enemy

Searows: Coming Clean
Find me in the raincoat
You could've sworn you were missing
We don't talk the whole way home
I leave the coat in the kitchen
Let me have a few more months
I'll talk to you when I'm ready
Say "I never got to lose it once"
So I do and you let me
But is this coming clean
Or am I kicking up dirt where I shouldn't?
And what's it gonna mean?
I can't fix all the things that you couldn't
Do I just end up losing my footing?
But I don't wanna be your angel
Wanna see you cut off a limb
Nobody wins
If I kill you
Would I have to forgive you still?
Sterilize the thing you know
Give it to somebody who's strong
Fallout from the glass you broke
There's still a piece in my palm
And just like that, we're starting over
Just when we were getting into it
Fake your death and call it closure
Just like we would do when we were kids
But is this coming clean
Or am I digging up the bodies you buried?
And what's this supposed to mean?
Am I brave if the noise doesn't scare me?
If I make myself easy to carry?
But I don't wanna be your angel
Wanna see you cut off a limb
Nobody wins
If you killed me
I would have to forgive you still
I would've died for it
I would've died for it
I would've died for it
I would've died for it

Searows: Villain
I guess you thought I could fix the problem
You said, Tell me all that I'd miss
I don't know but I'm pretty sure
It gets better than this
And maybe I should've stopped
Believing but I really wanted to try
Said I'd saved
While I'm barely staying alive
And I knew it the second you walked the door
Yeah I had a bad feeling i started a war
I'm gonna fuck it all up
And I'll probably pay with my life
And I know that you told me
That everything's fine
But I wrote this story before it was mine
And I know there's a villain
But I'm worried it's me this time
So fake a better feeling take me as I am
At least I'm only making better plans
Turn me into a believer
Make me out as some old healer
I'll change for the better
And ill even make it last too
For you, for you for you, for you
For you, for you for you, for you
Turn me into a believer
I hardly recognize myself either
I'll change for the better
And I'll even make it last for you

Phoebe Bridgers: You Missed My Heart
Broke into her house, saw her sitting there
Drinking Coke and whiskey in her bra and underwear
Saw him in the kitchen, hanging up the phone
I asked him nicely once to pack his things and go
He gave her a reassuring look, said he wouldn't leave
But I asked him one more time, this time pulled out my shiv
Stuck him in the back, and I pulled it out slow
And I watched him fall down, and as the morning sun rose
He looked at me, he said
"You missed my heart, you missed my heart
You got me good, I knew you would
But you missed my heart, you missed my heart"
Were his last words before he died
Looking out the window, up at the blue sky
Listening to her scream, listening to her cry
A feeling of relief came over my soul
I couldn't take it any longer, and I lost control
I chased her up the stairs and I pinned her to the ground
And underneath her whimpering, I could hear the sirens sound
I rattled off a list of all the things I miss
Like going to the movies with her and the way she kissed me
Driving into downtown Wheeling, showing her off
Backyard barbecues and reunions in the park
I said I missed her skin when she started laughing
While I clenched down on her wrist
She said, "That's quite a list, but there's one thing you missed"
"You missed my heart, you missed my heart
That's quite a list, but what you really missed (you missed my heart)
You missed my heart, you missed my heart
That's quite a list, but what you really missed"
Running through the parking lot, running through the fields
Policemen on my back, something hit my skull and cracked
They dragged me off to jail, set a million dollar bail
Where I tried to tie a noose, but I failed and I broke loose
I went racing through the prison yard, shot down by a tower guard
He got me in the shins, and he got me in the arms
They strapped me in the gurney, took me off to the infirmary
Where the priest read my last rites
And just before everything went dark, I said
"He missed my heart, he missed my heart (you missed my heart)
He got me good, I knew he would
But he missed my heart, he missed my heart" (you missed my heart)
And just before everything went dark
The most poetic dream came flowing like the sea
Laying there, my lifeblood draining out of me
A childhood scene, night sky, moon beams
Fishing with my friends, sitting in the wild reeds
Watching the Ohio River flow at night
Waiting for the bullheaded catfishes to bite
Downriver from the Moundsville Prison graveyard
Downriver from the Moundsville Prison graveyard
Downriver from the Moundsville Prison graveyard
Downriver from the Moundsville Prison graveyard
Downriver from the Moundsville Prison graveyard
